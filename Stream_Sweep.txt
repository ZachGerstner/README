Purpose: XDD Parameter Sweep with 1TB tarball and 1TB serial transfers
===============================================================================
Prerequisits: must have xdd installed (see XDD_install.txt)

Sweep 1: Streams(tarball)
----------------------------------------------------------
Date Conducted: 17 September 2015
1. cloned script from nlmills account

2. Tarred approximately 1TB group of sra files on ofstest014
        note: Will take up a LOT of memory
        note: Will take about a day to tar

3. Began a screen session (recommended due to 10ish hour run time)
        'screen'

4. modified script (Sections to be modified are labelled)

5.  Ran script
        'sh script01.sh'

6. Disconnected from screen
        'ctrl+a d'

7. Upon completion of transfer captured stdout
        note: BE VERY CARFUL HERE YOU MESS THIS UP THEN YOU LOSE THE DATA!!
        'ctrl+A : hardcopy -h screen.log'

8. Convert the printed rate to Megabytes per second
        x*1.024

Note: Transfer rates generated from this test may be effected if the tar is not
        deleted from destination machine after EACH transfer. This is due to
        the lack of overhead from file writing housekeeping.

Note: Had to re-run this test due to the script not successfully removing the
        tar from destination machine.

Sweep 2: Blocksize with best streams from Sweep 1(tarball)
----------------------------------------------------------
Date Conducted: 21 September 2015
note: Make sure the previous screen session was properly ended will cause
        problems later

1. Cloned Script from nlmills github account
        'git clone transfer02.sh'
2. Began a screen session (recommended due to 10ish hour run time)
        'screen'
        note: used same tarball from Sweep 1.

3. modified script (Sections to be modified are labelled)

4. ran script
        'sh transfer02.sh'

5. Disconnected from screen session
        'ctrl+a d'

6. Upon completion of transfer captured stdout
        note:BE VERY CAREFUL HERE YOU MESS THIS UP THEN DATA WILL BE LOST!!
        'ctrl+A : hardcopy -h screen2.log'

7. Convert the printed rates to Megabytes per second
        'x*1.024

note: Had to re-run this experiment I somehow cancelled the screen session before
        recording the data.

Sweep 1.2: Re-Run Stream Sweep Due to Network Changes
------------------------------------------------------
Repeated Sweep 1 after Utah did a major network update
