Purpose Installing and Running XDD transfer
==================================================================================
Preference
i. if you have password protected accounts, make sure that you install and
   authorize ssh keys to allow uninterupted access between them.
        ssh-keygen; cp ssh-keygen on both nodes; cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys;
==================================================================================
1. Clone the master branch from Nick Mill's Git hub
        git://github.com/nlmills/xdd.git
1. Clone functional branch from Nick Mill's Git hub
        git checkout e2e_xni
2. cd into xdd dir and run autoconf
        cd ./xdd;autoconf
3. once autoconf finishes run autoheader
        autoheader
4. Verify that the clone and set up were the appropriate branches by checking
   the log.
        top of your git log should be 5f7abcd5b4db41523c487e9d34f9d0594caacc25

5. Fetch ecdsa-0.11.tar.gz and pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz from Nick Mill's palmetto account
        scp zigerst@user.palmetto.clemson.edu:/home/nlmills/xddshare/ecdsa-0.11.tar.gz contrib
        scp zigerst@user.palmetto.clemson.edu:/home/nlmills/xddshare/pycrypto-2.6.1.tar.gz contrib

6. In the event that Python is not fully installed, the following will be needed.
        sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev python-devel
7. Configure xdd
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/sof/xdd --disable-ib --disable-xfs --disable-numa

***NOTE: dont move will break the thing apparently after install***
8. Make the following changes to the .bashrc file, ensure that you place the text at the TOP of the
   file(ubuntu has something that prevents it from working...)
        vim .bashrc
        #for xdd mubojumbo
        export PATH=$HOME/sof/xdd/bin:$PATH
9. Log off and log back in to make changes effective. OR use source
        source .bashrc
10. test that the .bashrc change took effect.
        cd
        xddmcp -h
11. Generate a test file of 1Gb
        xdd -target file3 -op write -bytes 1000000000 -datapattern random
12. Transfer the file
        xddmcp -t 4 file1 node-1:/users/zigers0/
